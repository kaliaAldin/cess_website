    "text": "A world where resources are stewarded for the collective good, where communities reclaim their rights to land, water, and self-determination. Our movement is شعبي (of the people), أهلي (rooted in community), and global in solidarity. We harness the power of technology, art, research, and grassroots organizing to amplify voices, expose injustices, and build alternatives."

    "heading": "About CESS",
    "body": "The Center for Environmental and Social Studies (CESS) is conceived as a critical knowledge organization that seeks to expand legal literacy, strengthen public accountability, and deepen structural transparency within Sudan’s extractive sectors—fields historically shaped by dispossession, militarization, and opaque political–economic arrangements. Our work extends across strategically exploited resources, including water, energy, gold, and land. As a research collective, CESS is committed to advancing social justice and confronting the ecological and economic violences embedded in extractivist regimes. We work to produce and democratize knowledge, defend environmental and human rights, and support communities facing displacement, exploitation, and systemic marginalization. Built through collaboration and solidarity across research institutions, civil society, and grassroots networks, CESS provides access to investigative studies, specialized reports, and emerging analyses. We create spaces for engagement between affected communities, activists, scholars, and practitioners. Our aim is not merely to inform but to intervene—to amplify marginalized voices, contest extractive power structures, and contribute to alternative development pathways grounded in justice and collective autonomy. We encourage users to connect with us, participate, critique, and collaborate; these interactions are crucial for strengthening public consciousness, expanding community agency, and ensuring that struggles around resource governance reach wider audiences. In the face of intensifying threats posed by Sudan’s extractive economy—and amid expanding possibilities in digital media—building accessible and reliable knowledge infrastructures has become essential. This platform offers counter-narratives to dominant state and corporate discourses, supports community organizing, and helps expose the political and ecological costs of extractivism in Sudan."

      "header": "CONFLICT GOLD",
      "body": "Sudan’s gold sector has become central to the dynamics of the current war, shaping patterns of violence, displacement, and illicit trade. More than 80% of Sudan’s gold is produced by artisanal and unregulated miners, yet both “legal” and “illegal” actors operate within the same networks. Armed groups, private companies, and regional intermediaries benefit from this hybrid system, while international sanctions have failed to disrupt the underlying structures that finance the conflict. Despite widespread recognition of these dynamics, Sudanese gold is still not formally recognized as “conflict gold” in global supply chains. Through this project, CESS brings together affected communities, technical experts, legal practitioners, and civil society organizations to build a unified evidence base and advance a coordinated advocacy campaign. The initiative documents the links between gold extraction and conflict—including land dispossession, child labor, unsafe working conditions, and smuggling—and aligns this analysis with international conflict-mineral standards. The project’s goal is to establish Sudan’s gold as “conflict gold” at the global level, strengthen accountability mechanisms, and amplify the voices of miners and communities most affected by extraction. By supporting local-led knowledge production and developing an international advocacy network, the campaign seeks to promote transparency, disrupt war-financing channels, and contribute to broader pathways toward peace and economic justice in Sudan."
